# Fashion Recommendation System
In this project I have designed a fashion recommendation system which will take one image from user and will show ten similar images. Model : Resnet50
There are two python files namely a.> feature_extraction: In this file I have extracted 2048 features for each image in the given dataset (image folder).
                                  b.> fashion_recommendation_system: In this file I have taken an image as an input and then display 10 similar images.
# How to run
1. First run the feature_extraction file
2. Then run the fashion_recommendation_system file. Once this file is running a dialog box will appear and you need to select an image(when you select image from dialogbox you need to change file type as 'allfiles')from image folder and then you will get 10 similar object, for this you just press enter buttom and get one after another recomendation.
